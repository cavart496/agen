Utils to generate audio

Requires to clone https://github.com/thorwhalen/ut and put ut in your PYTHONPATH.

You should be able to do things like:
    import ut

You'll also need (if you don't have them already) some libraries such as:
    librosa
    soundfile

If you get an import error on X, just try to do:
    pip install X
in your terminal.

If that doesn't work, google the library and see how to install it (for e.g. soundfile is actually
obtained by doing
    pip install pysoundfile

Buggers!
